This is an Android Application for Duta Wacana Christian University Management Class. I created this for my last project in college, this application actually have a website but it doesnt connect each other. The website is called E-Class, E-class is a website that contains information and many things to help university, lecturer, and student to improve lecture activities. Students can download course material, latest homework, latest news, submit the homework , and many more. So this application is like prototype with all of the real E-Class function in it. 

I'm trying to fix the problem that students had so I created this application in native app.

I'm using :
1 . Java 
2 . Node.js
3 . Firebase
